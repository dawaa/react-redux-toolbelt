# react-redux-toolbelt

Just nifty things I've come to want to use in every React project I work with
nowadays.

## Installation

```
$ npm|yarn install|add react-redux-toolbelt
```

Also make sure to add to your `.babelrc` the following to make use of the
static props in your classes.

```jsonc
{
    "plugins": [ "transform-class-properties" ]
}
```
